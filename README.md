<p>Inspired by The Witcher series of books and games, this mod add functional Witcher Medallions to the world of Minecraft!</p>

<u></u><h2><strong>Features:</strong></h2>
* Added 6 different medallions from each Witcher school plus an Ancient Wolf Medallion inspired by the design of the Netflix show, they all work exactly the same, they only differ aesthetically.
* The medallion you have equipped will have a "soulbound" enchantment by default, so you will keep it even when you die.
* The medallion has two ways of detecting monsters, passive and active.
